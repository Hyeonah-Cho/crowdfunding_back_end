## Planning:

### Concept/Name

### Intended Audience/User Stories

{{ Who are your intended audience? How will they use the website? }}

### Front End Pages/Functionality

- {{ A page on the front end }}
  - {{ A list of dot-points showing functionality is available on this page }}
  - {{ etc }}
  - {{ etc }}
- {{ A second page available on the front end }}
  - {{ Another list of dot-points showing functionality }}
  - {{ etc }}

### API Spec

{{ Fill out the table below to define your endpoints. An example of what this might look like is shown at the bottom of the page.

It might look messy here in the PDF, but once it's rendered it looks very neat!

It can be helpful to keep the markdown preview open in VS Code so that you can see what you're typing more easily. }}
